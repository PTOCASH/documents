PTO builds the Uniswap DEX of the EOS world, with the goal of creating a free and open source Swap protocol that is more efficient and safer than the Ethereum network!

PTO-Dex is a market maker algorithm based on a constant product and the agreement also allows any developer to create his own trading pair. At the same time, the agreement has a mining incentive to provide PTO for market makers who provide liquidity, whether it is a trader or a market maker, which has no transfer fees like Ethereum and other networks during the process of engaging in transactions!

The PTO activates with the largest possible model of market maker incentives and provides liquidity and transaction depth for major project parties. The continuous liquidity coin pool maximizes the advantages of the decentralized trading platform. User assets rely on secure PTO-DeFi Agreement without need to deposit funds to institutions, and the price is calculated by algorithm based on the available liquidity.

The PTOâ€™s efficient DeFi consensus adopts contract account multi-signature and future black hole agreement mechanisms. After the PTO ecological conditions are mature, community governance will be started. The contract account will be signed by community leaders to ensure contract security.

Although the current EOS ecosystem is not as prosperous as the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem, the PTO R&D team still targets on the EOS protocol as the core protocol framework of Dex. Currently, DeFi based on the Ethereum network has several flaws:
1. The transfer speed is slow;
2. Transfer fees are often too high due to network congestion;
3. The abuse of authorization by the DeFi contract of the allow authorization model of the Ethereum network will lead to a great security risk of losing coins in the security of user assets.
On the contrary, EOS has extremely fast transfer speed and does not endure the slow transfer waiting any more. At the same time, there is no handling fee, which saves user transaction costs, and there are no security issues caused by the allow authorization model on ETH.

The PTO-Dex agreement is about to be opened recently, and it also opens the liquid mining mechanism of market maker. Currently, you can make an appointment on the www.pto.cash official website to apply for the seed currency subscription of market maker liquid mining.
